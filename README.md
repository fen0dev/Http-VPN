# HTTP-VPN in C
 Multi-Protocol HTTP and VPN Server in C
 
 This project provides a robust implementation of a multi-threaded HTTP server and a basic VPN server in C. The HTTP server supports handling concurrent client requests over TCP/IP, serving static content and handling basic dynamic requests. It includes features such as socket reuse, error handling, and logging capabilities.

The VPN server allows for secure tunneling using either UDP or TCP protocols, facilitating encrypted communication between clients and the server. It supports concurrent VPN client connections and integrates OpenSSL for secure data transmission.

# Key Features:

    HTTP Server: Supports GET and POST requests, serving static files and handling basic dynamic content.
    VPN Server: Facilitates secure tunneling using UDP or TCP, integrating OpenSSL for encryption.
    Concurrency: Multi-threaded architecture for handling multiple client connections simultaneously.
    Error Handling: Comprehensive error checking and logging to track server operations.
    Cross-Platform: Designed for compatibility across Linux, Unix, and other POSIX-compliant systems.

This project is suitable for educational purposes, allowing developers to explore socket programming, network security concepts, and server-side application development in C. It serves as a practical example of implementing both HTTP and VPN server functionalities in a single application.
